# Godot Hexagon TileMap 

> A Hexagon Tilemap in Godot


- Followed the Hexagon Tilemap tutorial at [How to Create Hexagon TileMap in Godot 4.3+ by Wabsa Studios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v55h6hTFWLw). 
- Used the tilesmaps here:

  - [Hexpack by Swiss Arcade Game Entertainment](https://phoenix1291.itch.io/hexapack)

## Reflections
I followed this tutorial for a potential project with my internship. I completed it fairly quickly and it had very nice results.
I think the end result is very effective and it takes only a few minutes to create so I would gladly do this again for a bigger project
